# Project Report: Iris Android Application

## 1. Summary

This report details the analysis, build, and verification process for the Iris Android application. Iris is a privacy-focused, offline-first LLM platform for Android that uses `llama.cpp` for its core chatbot functionality.

## 2. Analysis

I began by analyzing the project structure and UI flow. The application uses a `ModalNavigationDrawer` for its main navigation and follows the MVVM architecture pattern. The key screens and their functionalities were documented in `UI_FLOW.md`.

## 3. Building the App

To build the app, I performed the following steps:

1.  **Downloaded a model:** I downloaded the `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q6_K_L.gguf` model and placed it in the `app/src/main/assets/` directory.
2.  **Created `local.properties`:** I created a `local.properties` file and set the `PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY` to an empty string, as I did not have a valid key.
3.  **Resolved a build error:** The initial build failed due to a missing import in `SearchActivity.kt`. I added the required `import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxWidth` statement to fix the issue.
4.  **Successfully built the app:** After fixing the import, the app was successfully built using the `./gradlew assembleDebug` command. The debug APK is located at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

## 4. Verification

I was unable to verify the inference capabilities of the application due to the limitations of the sandboxed environment. I cannot install or run the Android application, and there were no relevant unit tests to execute.

## 5. Conclusion

The Iris Android application was successfully analyzed and built. The project is well-structured and uses modern Android development practices. While I was unable to verify the inference functionality, the successful build indicates that the project is in a good state.
